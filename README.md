# Lenovo-310-14ISK-Hackintosh-OpenCore

Currently running Big Sur 11.6.8 with OpenCore 0.8.4 nightly

Made according to [xkhoir's EFI](https://github.com/xkhoir/Lenovo-310-14ISK-Hackintosh-EFI-OpenCore)

Main differences:

My model is Xiaoxin-310-14ISK (Intel Core i7 6500U Skylake) with BIOS version 0XCN45WW installed.

Change ApplePS2SmartTouchPad.kext to VoodooPS2Controller.kext(unmodded) to get Fn Key function work.

Also add some other patches.
